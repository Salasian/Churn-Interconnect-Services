# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Interconnect Services

Welcome to the repository for our machine learning project focused on **predicting customer churn** for a telecom company, **Interconnect Services**. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave, allowing the company to take proactive retention actions like offering promotions or alternative plans.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Interconnect Services provides internet, phone, and entertainment services with various contract and billing options. This project uses customer data to build predictive models that classify customers as either **likely to churn** or **stay**.

We started with exploratory data analysis and advanced to machine learning modeling using both **Logistic Regression** and **LightGBM**, achieving a final model with a **0.92 AUC-ROC score**.

## 🚀 Main Features

- Handling of missing and inconsistent data  
- Categorical encoding and feature standardization  
- Feature engineering (social scores, ratios)  
- Comparison between models (Logistic Regression vs LightGBM)  
- AUC-ROC evaluation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Business-friendly interpretation of results

## 📁 Project Files and Documentation

This repository contains two main folders for documentation, one in **English** and one in **Spanish**, to make the project accessible to a wider audience.  
Each folder contains the same three files, offering full context in both languages:

| File Name           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **`Final Report.md`**/ **`Reporte Final.md`** | 📘 A complete summary of the work done, including steps carried out, difficulties encountered, and final evaluation using LightGBM. This helps you understand how the project evolved and why decisions were made. |
| **`Work Plan.md`** / **`Plan de Trabajo.md`** | 📋 A detailed breakdown of the project's goals and structure of the source data. Spanish version: `Plan de Trabajo.md`, English version: `Work Plan.md`. |
| **`Analysis.md`**/**`Analisis.md`**  | 🛠️ A step-by-step outline of the technical process, from importing and cleaning data to training and evaluating predictive models. Both versions follow the same structure and content, adapted for language. |

> 📂 **Folders**:
> - `/English`: All documentation in English  
> - `/Spanish`: All documentation in Spanish
