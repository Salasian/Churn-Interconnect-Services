# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Interconnect Services

Welcome to the repository for our machine learning project focused on **predicting customer churn** for a telecom company, **Interconnect Services**. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave, allowing the company to take proactive retention actions like offering promotions or alternative plans.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Interconnect Services provides internet, phone, and entertainment services with various contract and billing options. This project uses customer data to build predictive models that classify customers as either **likely to churn** or **stay**.

We started with exploratory data analysis and advanced to machine learning modeling using both **Logistic Regression** and **LightGBM**, achieving a final model with a **0.92 AUC-ROC score**.

## 🚀 Main Features

- Handling of missing and inconsistent data  
- Categorical encoding and feature standardization  
- Feature engineering (social scores, ratios)  
- Comparison between models (Logistic Regression vs LightGBM)  
- AUC-ROC evaluation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Business-friendly interpretation of results
